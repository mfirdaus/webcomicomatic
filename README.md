Chakapp - A javascript chatting service. Hopefully with classroom use in mind
========

In hopes of implementing a backchannel in classroom, this will be designed with a mobile device in mind. Need to get the basic chat functions done + scaling issues [At least be able to support 60 concurrent users/students].

Then implement useful features for students
- Voting particular comments?
- Sticky comments by teacher. Star?
- Hashtags? Search?
- Allow seperate columns? One or two person types notes?
- Allow replies?
