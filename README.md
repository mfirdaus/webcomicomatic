Webcomicomatic - A comic bookmark/queueing thing built especially for mobile devices
========

This script was meant to replace a folder of webcomic bookmarks that I go through everyday. Further more, a folder full of bookmarks is really bad on a mobile device.

How to use
----------
1. Save the HTM file and Edit the HTM file and replace the existing links (bonus. Those are my daily trawls.) with your links.
2. Upload it to somewhere you can access online. I use dropbox's public folder personally
3. Open it up in your browser of choice.
4. Click anywhere on page. This will load the first link.
5. Enjoy webcomic.
6. Close tab to return to webcomicomatic.
7. Click anywhere on page to load the second link.
8. Rinse and repeat.

This may sound needlesly complicated, but it's actually quite easy and quick to go through the list of webcomics with this. I've been using this for almost a year [this was built to be used for iPad3] and it's great.

I hope you enjoy it. Any questions (or webcomic recommendations) should be directed to @mfirdaus on the twitters.
